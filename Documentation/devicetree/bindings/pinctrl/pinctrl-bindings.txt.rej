+== Using generic pinconfig options ==
+
+Generic pinconfig parameters can be used by defining a separate node containing
+the applicable parameters (and optional values), like:
+
+pcfg_pull_up: pcfg_pull_up {
+	bias-pull-up;
+	drive-strength = <20>;
+};
+
+This node should then be referenced in the appropriate pinctrl node as a phandle
+and parsed in the driver using the pinconf_generic_parse_dt_config function.
+
+Supported configuration parameters are:
+
+bias-disable		- disable any pin bias
+bias-high-impedance	- high impedance mode ("third-state", "floating")
+bias-bus-hold		- latch weakly
+bias-pull-up		- pull up the pin
+bias-pull-down		- pull down the pin
+bias-pull-pin-default	- use pin-default pull state
+drive-push-pull		- drive actively high and low
+drive-open-drain	- drive with open drain
+drive-open-source	- drive with open source
+drive-strength		- sink or source at most X mA
+input-schmitt-enable	- enable schmitt-trigger mode
+input-schmitt-disable	- disable schmitt-trigger mode
+input-debounce		- debounce mode with debound time X
+low-power-enable	- enable low power mode
+low-power-disable	- disable low power mode
+output-low		- set the pin to output mode with low level
+output-high		- set the pin to output mode with high level
+
+Arguments for parameters:
+
+- bias-pull-up, -down and -pin-default take as optional argument on hardware
+  supporting it the pull strength in Ohm. bias-disable will disable the pull.
+
+- drive-strength takes as argument the target strength in mA.
+
+- input-debounce takes the debounce time in usec as argument
+  or 0 to disable debouncing
+
+All parameters not listed here, do not take an argument.
+
+More in-depth documentation on these parameters can be found in
+<include/linux/pinctrl/pinconfig-generic.h>
