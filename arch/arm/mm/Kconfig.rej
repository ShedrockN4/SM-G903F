+	  Warning: disabling this option may break user programs.
+
+	  Provide kuser helpers in the vector page.  The kernel provides
+	  helper code to userspace in read only form at a fixed location
+	  in the high vector page to allow userspace to be independent of
+	  the CPU type fitted to the system.  This permits binaries to be
+	  run on ARMv4 through to ARMv7 without modification.
+
+	  See Documentation/arm/kernel_user_helpers.txt for details.
+
+	  However, the fixed address nature of these helpers can be used
+	  by ROP (return orientated programming) authors when creating
+	  exploits.
+
+	  If all of the binaries and libraries which run on your platform
+	  are built specifically for your platform, and make no use of
+	  these helpers, then you can turn this option off to hinder
+	  such exploits. However, in that case, if a binary or library
+	  relying on those helpers is run, it will receive a SIGILL signal,
+	  which will terminate the program.
+
+	  Say N here only if you are absolutely certain that you do not
+	  need these helpers; otherwise, the safe option is to say Y.
